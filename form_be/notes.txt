angular form field component layout:
sp_field->

    toggle,
    ID)

can make button activate input all in HTML:
   <button mat-icon-button (click)="fileInput.click()">
      <mat-icon>attach_file</mat-icon>
    </button>
    <input #fileInput type="file" formControlName="file" style="display: none;">

in fact, should see if any django abstract classes are good for what you are thinking about using since this is what most libraries will work with
need serializer for rest api to translate python data to json
